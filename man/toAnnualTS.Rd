\title{Convert time series to annual frequency: The toAnnualTS function converts a time series with n observations per year to an annual time series (one observation per year). The main concept is to select observations per year closest to a given day of year that have no missing value (NA). Here, the day of year for which the seasonality is maximum is being used.}
\usage{
toAnnualTS(tsseas, tsi, obspyr, dtmax = 1/12)
}
\arguments{
\item{tsseas}{vector of observations (time series) representing the seasonal component of the time series to be converted}

\item{tsi}{vector of observations (time series) that needs to be converted to an annual time series}

\item{obspyr}{number of observations per year of the time series to be converted}

\item{dtmax}{maximum time (expressed in year, so 1/12 equals one month) between selected observation and the seasonal maximum}
}
\value{
vector of observations (time series) with annual observation frequency
}
