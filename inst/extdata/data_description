1. Landsat surface reflectance 
___________________________________

.......................................
Description:

Surface reflectance improves comparison between multiple images over the same region by accounting for atmospheric effects such as aerosol scattering and thin clouds, which can help in the detection and characterization of Earth surface change. Surface reflectance is generated from Level-1 inputs that meet the <76 degrees Solar Zenith Angle constraint and include the required auxiliary data inputs to generate a scientifically viable product.

Landsat surface reflectance data are available globally for the following instruments:

   - Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI): April 2013 to present
   - Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+): July 1999 to present
   - Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM): March 1984 to May 2012
   - Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM): July 1982 to December 1993

Landsat Surface Reflectance output from Landsat 8 contains:
• Surface Reflectance data files (Bands 1–7)
• Radiometric Saturation QA band (radsat_qa)
• Surface Reflectance Aerosol QA band
• Level 2 Pixel Quality Assessment band (pixel_qa)
• Surface Reflectance metadata file (.xml)

Landsat Surface Reflectance output from Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 5 TM, and Landsat 4 TM will contain:
• Surface Reflectance data files (Bands 1-5, 7)
• Surface Reflectance quality files (sr_cloud_qa, sr_atmos_opacity)
• Radiometric Saturation Quality Assessment band (radsat_qa)
• Level 2 Pixel Quality Assessment band (pixel_qa)
• Surface Reflectance metadata file (.xml)

Filenames utilize the productID followed by “_sr_,” as exemplified by “LT04_L1TP_023028_19821212_20161004_01_T1_sr_*”.

More information on the Landsat 4-7 and 8 datasets can be found in 'LSDS-1370_L4-7_SurfaceReflectance-LEDAPS_ProductGuide-v2.pdf' and 'LSDS-1368_L8_SurfaceReflectanceCode-LASRC_ProductGuide-v2.pdf', respectively.

2. Land cover data [MapBiomas]
___________________________________
.......................................
Description:

GeoTIFF file of yearly land cover and land use maps that are derived from Landsat mosaics. Each band of the geoTIFF file refers to a particular year. The data have a spatial resolution of 30m and its time span ranges between 1985 and 2018.  

Each pixel of the raster band contains a value that refers to a land cover type. A description of each land cover class can be found in '[en] Legend description collection 4.0.pdf' and the corresponding pixel IDs in 'MAPBIOMAS_Legenda_Cores__1_.xlsx'.

3. Burned area [CCI Fire]
___________________________________

.......................................
Description:

GeoTIFF files that contain spatio-temporal information on burned areas. Per month, two layers are provided indicating the date of detection and the confidence level of the pixel detected as burned.

The date of detection layer corresponds to the day in which the fire was first detected, also commonly called Julian Day. The date of the burned pixel may not be coincident with the actual burning date, but most probably taken from one to several days afterwards, depending on image availability and cloud coverage. For areas with low cloud coverage, the detected date of burn should be very close to the actual date of burn, while for areas with high cloud coverage the date may be from several days or even weeks after the fire is over.

Possible values: 
• 0 (zero): when the pixel is not burned. 
• 1 to 366: day of the first detection when the pixel is burned. 
• -1: when the pixel is not observed in the month. 
• -2: used for pixels that are not burnable: water bodies, bare areas, urban areas, permanent snow and ice.

The confidence level is the probability that the pixel is actually burned. A pixel with a confidence level of 80 means that it is burned with a probability of 80%, which implies that the input data and the algorithm result in a fairly high belief of the pixel being burned. A low value (for instance, 5) would indicate a strong belief of the pixel not being burned. These values can also be called “per pixel” uncertainty (pb). It should be noted that this uncertainty is just a description of how much one can trust the interpretation of the burned/unburned state of a pixel given the uncertainty of the data, the choices done in modelling, etc. It does not give an indication about whether the estimates of BA are close to the truth, as that is really the role of validation.

Possible values: 
- 0 (zero): when the pixel is not observed in the month, or it is not burnable (not vegetated). 
- 1 to 100: Probability values. The closer to 100, the higher the confidence that the pixel is actually burned. This value expresses the uncertainty of the detection for all pixels, even if they are classified as unburned.

4. Tree cover [Hansen tree cover]
___________________________________
.......................................
Description:

This dataset is the result from time-series analysis of Landsat images in characterizing global forest extent and change from 2000 through 2018.

The data consists of a geoTIFF layer with tree canopy cover for year 2000 (treecover2000), defined as canopy closure for all vegetation taller than 5m in height. This is encoded as a percentage per output grid cell, in the range 0–100.

Additionally a data mask (datamask) layer is provided. This layer contains three values representing areas of no data (0), mapped land surface (1), and permanent water bodies (2).
